<!-- Note: To clear columns (both nested and just stacked columns right inside the 
.container, you can give the parent a class of "clearfix," wrap each row of columns in a 
"<div class='row'>" or follow the last column in a row with a "<br class='clear'>." They 
all work and it's up to your personal preference. -->
